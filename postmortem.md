# Assignment 2 Postmortem

## How difficult was this assignment?
This assignment was only a little bit difficult in that it was tedious trying to move CSS to get it just right.


## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?
I learned about the pseudo elements.


## Did you use any of the links provided in the homework? If so, which ones?
I used the links for the pseudo-elements and then also looked them up on W3Schools.org as well.


## How could this assignment be improved?
The assignment is a great challenge just the way it is.


## Any other comments?
This is probably the first time I've ever really done anything creative, and I'm quite proud of coming up with Fiona from Shrek.
